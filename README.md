### Step 2: Setup Project Files

1. Extract the `chatbot_project` folder
2. Copy the entire folder to XAMPP's `htdocs` directory:
   ```
   C:\xampp\htdocs\chatbot_project\  (Windows)
   /Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/chatbot_project/  (Mac)
   /opt/lampp/htdocs/chatbot_project/  (Linux)
   ```

### Step 3: Create Database

1. Open phpMyAdmin: http://localhost/phpmyadmin
2. Click "New" to create a new database
3. Name it: `ai_chatbot_db`
4. Select "utf8mb4_general_ci" as collation
5. Click "Create"

### Step 4: Import Database Schema

1. Select the `ai_chatbot_db` database
2. Click the "SQL" tab
3. Open `database/schema.sql` file with a text editor
4. Copy all the SQL code
5. Paste it into the SQL tab in phpMyAdmin
6. Click "Go" to execute

**Note**: The schema includes a default admin user:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

### Step 5: Configure Groq API

1. Visit https://console.groq.com/
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Generate an API key
4. Open `config/database.php`
5. Replace `YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key:
   ```php
   define('GROQ_API_KEY', 'gsk_your_actual_key_here');
   ```

### Step 6: Test the Application

1. Open your browser
2. Go to: http://localhost/chatbot_project/

## 🔧 How It Works

### Authentication Flow

1. User visits the site → redirected to `login.php` (if not logged in)
2. User logs in → credentials verified against database
3. Password is verified using `password_verify()` (secure hashing)
4. Session is created with user ID and username
5. User is redirected to chat interface

### Chat Flow

1. User types a message and clicks Send
2. JavaScript sends message to `/api/chat.php` via AJAX
3. PHP saves user message to database
4. PHP retrieves conversation history (last 10 messages)
5. PHP sends messages to Groq API with system prompt
6. Groq API returns AI response
7. PHP saves AI response to database
8. Response is sent back to JavaScript
9. JavaScript displays the response in chat UI

### Groq API Integration

The chatbot uses Groq's API with these settings:
- **Model**: `llama-3.1-8b-instant` (fast, efficient)
- **Temperature**: 0.7 (balanced creativity)
- **Max Tokens**: 1000 (response length limit)

**System Prompt** (defines chatbot personality):
```
"You are a helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable AI assistant. 
Your goal is to provide accurate, clear, and helpful responses 
to user questions. Be conversational and warm in your tone, 
but remain professional. If you don't know something, admit 
it honestly. Keep your responses concise but informative. 
Always be respectful and encouraging."
```
